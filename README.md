# VOID: A Budget-Aware Finite System for Thermodynamic Computation

This repository defines a formal system based on the rejection of actual infinity and the explicit inclusion of thermodynamic constraints in computation, observation, and cognition.

All logic is implemented in Coq. The system models a world where operations have finite cost, observations are limited by perceptual resolution, and computation consumes non-renewable budget.

VOID is not a metaphor. It is an alternative executable formalism ‚Äî one that assumes reality, perception, and knowledge all occur **within** finite, budgeted processes.

## üîß Structure

The system is organized into modular Coq files grouped into conceptual layers.

### 1. Core Foundations

| File                      | Description                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `void_finite_minimal.v`   | Defines finite natural numbers `F`, bounded successor structure. |
| `void_probability_minimal.v` | Implements `‚Ñô_ùîΩ`, finite probabilities (0 < p < 1). |
| `void_arithmetic.v`       | Arithmetic over `F` with cost-aware computation. |
| `void_budget_flow.v`      | General framework for budget-aware functions `fÃÇ: A √ó ùîπ ‚Üí B √ó ùîπ`. |

### 2. Thermodynamics and Entropy

| File                       | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `void_entropy.v`           | Heat as computation cost, conservation axioms.  |
| `void_entropy_integration.v` | Accumulation of entropy across composite processes. |

### 3. Geometric Layer

| File                    | Description                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `void_geometry.v`        | Defines vector space `V‚Çô` over ‚Ñô_ùîΩ without standard basis. |
| `void_symmetry_movement.v` | Budget-aware symmetry and motion operators.    |
| `void_geometry_basis.v` | Defines shapes as fields, space as distinguishability gradient.   |

### 4. Pattern and Neural Computation

| File                         | Description                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `void_pattern.v`             | Defines pattern space ùí´ = ùîΩ √ó ‚Ñô_ùîΩ.               |
| `void_pattern_algebra_extended.v` | Aggregation and interference of patterns.      |
| `void_pattern_thermo.v`      | Heat-aware pattern dynamics, refractory logic. |

### 5. Neural Adaptation and Signal Collapse

| File                        | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `void_crisis_relocation.v`  | Models crisis points and adaptive pattern relocation. |
| `void_memory_trace.v`       | Encodes decaying memory and persistence of activation. |
| `void_resonance.v`          | Detects reinforcement through repeated stimuli. |

### 6. Observer and Distinguishability

| File                          | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `void_distinguishability.v`   | Defines observer-based distinguishability `ùíü(O,e‚ÇÅ,e‚ÇÇ,b)`. |
| `void_probability_minimal.v`  | Core definition of ‚Ñô_ùîΩ (shared).             |

## üß™ How to Begin

1. Install Coq (version ‚â• 8.17 recommended).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start with:

```coq
Require Import void_finite_minimal.
Require Import void_arithmetic.
```

4. Explore `void_pattern.v` and `void_pattern_thermo.v` to understand how neural patterns activate and decay under thermodynamic constraints.

## üß≠ What This Is

VOID is an executable alternative to formal systems based on infinite sets, continuous spaces, and cost-free computation.

It replaces:

- ‚Ñï with `F` (finite natural numbers),
- [0,1] with `‚Ñô_ùîΩ` (open interval rational pairs),
- metric space with observer-resolution distinguishability,
- computation with budget-aware transitions,
- perception with patterns and bounded thresholds.

It models a world where **no process runs forever**, **no signal is infinitely fine**, and **no knowledge is free**.

## ü™ê Final Note

This system was developed under constraint ‚Äî physical, emotional, cognitive. It is not a protest against infinity, but a formal answer to the question: *what remains when it is gone?*

```
"Infinity is a habit. This is the first system to model what happens when it runs out."
